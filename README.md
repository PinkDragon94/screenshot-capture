Goals for the Exercise
Capture website screenshots using the Homepage Screenshot API and save the images locally. Ensure that parameters are handled correctly and responses are verified for successful results.
Correctly handle API requests and responses. Using Python
Validate the API response for success or failure.
Save image data to a local file if the request succeeds.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to interact with data and services from different providers in a structured way. The Homepage Screenshot API is used to capture screenshots of websites by providing a simple endpoint where you send a request with a URL as a parameter.

Python simplifies API interaction using libraries like requests. With a simple HTTP request, you can access services and get responses in formats such as JSON, which you can easily parse and use in your application.
